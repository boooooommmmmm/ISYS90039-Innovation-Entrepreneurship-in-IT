Some people are more innovate, some are more adapts.

When come to a problem

```
| Facet         | Adaptors           | Innovators  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ---------:|
| Originality   | Few solutions, most can be implemented | Many solutions, most of are impractical |
| Efficiency    | Clear about goal, process step by step| No detail. May do not know the goal|
| Governace     |Socially acceptable|Ignore the rules|	
```

* Not good for a company with all innovators, and easy to fail. 
* Adaptors and innovators no better. Depends on the situation.
* Adaptors are keeps business running. They satisfies the customers and bring the money.
* Innovators few. Think about what is the product after that. Worries about future.

### The first criterion for being a great innovation is that there is a market for it.
* Target segment?
* customer's needs/ want it/ buy it?

 <br> 

### The second criterion for being a great innovation is that it actually works.
* Will it work?
* Clear concept?
  Final product satisfy the market?

<br>

## Distinctive Characteristics of Information Technologies
* Digitalisation: primarily or entirely digital
* Moore’s Law: Change/improves quickly
* Network effects: Digital innovations more valuable
  <br>

## Whether, When, and How to Innovate with IT
Mindful: attending to an innovation with reasoning grounded in an organisation’s own facts and circumstances, examining the claims for the benefits of an innovation in light of the organisation’s particular situation.
<br> 

->根据自身组织的情况来进行创新和研究。
<br> 

* Mindless:  being content with “everyone is doing it” as a rationale for adoption, and accepting innovations promoted by consultants and by CEOs who encounter fashionable ideas.
* Goal: be a prudent and discerning innovator
