# Week 2

This week is talking about business process innovation and process map exercise.

<br />

### What is business process

“**a structured, measured set of activities designed to produce a specific output for a particular customer or market.** It implies a strong emphasis on how work is done within an organization, in contrast to a product focus’s emphasis on what. A process is thus a specific **ordering of work activities** across time and space, with a beginning and an end, and clearly **defined inputs and outputs**: a structure for action. Processes are the structure by which an organisation does what is necessary to produce value for its customers.” 
<br />

During design the process, we need to think:
* What could possibly go wrong?

<br />

**Process Innovation:** 

Improving the way you do the business/New technology. - Have more frequency and less degree of change. ->assembly line

**Business model innovation:** 

Launching a new business. - Have lower frequency and more degree of change.

**Product/services innovation:** 

Commercial products and new offerings for customers. - frequency and degree of change in the middle.
<br />


### Make process better

Auto, prefill, make system stable, 

### why process chart is import?
under control, in IT need be clear flow between computer and human in process. 

<br />

<br />

Overtime, the mix innovation shifts. Form product innovation at the beginning and process innovation later on.

When turn to services, it inverse. Process innovation at the beginning, latter product innovation.

**Dominant design** can rise up product innovation and reduce process innovation. <br />
-> Do to innovation together is risky.<br />
-> If a dominant design happens, product/process innovation will rise, another will go down.

<br />
<br />

<br />

## Diffusion of innovation 

<br />

### Reengineering

-> If you get a process don't perform, don't try to fix it. Throw out and start out a new one. <br /> 
-> 业务流程重组  <br /> 
-> very popular at the beginning.  -> 75% largest companies in the USA use it.

->not use it anymore.<br /> 

**Why do we not use it?**

If you get a process don't perform, don't try to fix it. Throw out and start out a new one. <br />

- many companies cannot offer it.<br />
- The world change quickly.(IT services)<br />
- Soon became synonymous with staff cuts, outsourcing, and off-shoring.<br />
- IT support new processes took a long time to create.<br />
- many failures <br />

<hr>

<br />

If in the internal process innovation: -> not consider about external things
Current performance: Time, Quality, Cost, Flexibility—>the availability of changing input/output (可以接受新的output的程度)
, etc.
Improvement practices: Resequencing, Set-up time reduction, JIT supplies, “Informating” ->  It is the process that translates descriptions and measurements of activities, events and objects into information. By doing so, these activities become visible to the organization.<br /> 
->when producing a product, it will also produce the information about themselves. (translating information into action also register data about those automated activities) 



### New External Process Innovation

![](PIC/week2_1.png)

##### Existing External Process Innovation:

1. Process innovation Candidates
2. Improvement Process
3. Changes in Process Performance

##### New External Process Innovation

1. Process Creation (emergent technology) -> technical uncertainty
2. Process Diffusion (developed technology)
3. Change occurs when a need and a way of resolving that need are recognised simultaneously.

<br />

#### Diffusion/Accepts

Diffusion means spread.

*  "S" shape

*  Not all get 100%

*  The more people involved in the decision, the slower the diffusion

*  Social system – norms, innovation capacity, perceived needs or gaps 


##### Adoption Level

Tipping point 

Infamous Chasm -> fail
