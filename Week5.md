## Product innovation

### Inside organisation innovation

* Keep security
* Easy



<br />

### Open innovation 

Innovation not only inside of organisation. People tried, and satisfied in it.

* Not innovation inside the company, let public join the innovation./Need work with smart people inside and outside
* External R&D can create significant value
* Better business model and getting market first
* Making profit by using our IP
* Pertner with universilities to create knowledge and encourage use outside our field.

<br />
<br />

## Customer knowledge

* Customer knowledge = understanding customers’ preferences
* Pre-launch
* Post-launch (pre is better)

<br />

### Pre-launch

* Idea generation
* Concept refinement (features and design)
* Product development
* Product testing

Get idea -> refinement -> develop -> test ->launch

### Risk

* Increased complexity
* Decreased control

### What can increase success?

* Customer needs
* Company capabilities
  <br />
  <br />

#### Organisation should treat customers as:

* Information Sources
* Co-developers
* Innovators
* How to listen to customers
  * If their needs are widely varied, using customers as information sources is not helpful
  * Let them be **innovators** when their needs are tacit (hard to explain, no use to talk with them).
  * Firms with a higher degree of flexibility are best placed to use customers as
    **innovators**
  * Firms focusing on market exploitation should consider customers as **co-developers**.

<br />

### Benefits of participants 

* Cognitive (认知的) – learning, understanding
* Social – connections with relevant others
* Personal (status) – credibility, status, confidence
* Hedonic (享乐) – aesthetic, pleasurable experiences/happiness

<br />

### What is important for success?

* Intelligent-failure **reward system** (failure is good, repeat failure for the same reason is not good, intelligent failure is good, that is how we learn...)
* Cross-functional NPD (New product development) teams
* Productive conflict management (people come different place..)
* Organisational goal of creating leading-edge products and services 

<br />
